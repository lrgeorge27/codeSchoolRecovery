MongoDB Level 5 Common Aggregations

Find the number of potions per vendor
Aggregation framework allows for advanced computations
> db.potions.aggregate(  //takes stage operators as parameters
    [{"$group": {"_id": "$vendor_id"}}] //$group stage operator used to group data by any field specified
    )
    //$vendor_id - field names that begin with $ are called "field paths" and are linked to a field in a document
    //"_id" is the group key, anything that comes after is an accumulator

Anything specified after the group key is and accumulator. Accumulators take a single expression and compute the expression for grouped documents. 
    
> db.potions.aggregate(  
    [{"$group": {"_id": "$vendor_id", "total": {"$sum": 1}}}] 
                    //$group key                //add 1 for each matching doc, accumulator 
    )

When fields begin with a $ they are operators that preform a task
When values begin with a $ they represent field paths that point to the value

> db.potions.aggregate([  
    {"$group": {
    "_id": "$vendor_id", 
    "total": {"$sum": 1},
    "grade_total": {"$sum": "$grade"} //second accumulator, sum grade for potions
    }
    } 
    ])

Averaging the grade for vendor
> db.potions.aggregate(  
    [{"$group": {
    "_id": "$vendor_id", 
    "avg_grade": {"$avg": "$grade"}
    }
    }
    ])


Get the Max and Min the grade for vendor
> db.potions.aggregate(  
    [{"$group": {
    "_id": "$vendor_id", 
    "max_grade": {"$max": "$grade"},
    "min_grade": {"$min": "$grade"},

    }
    }
    ])
