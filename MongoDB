//MongoDB Level 1.1

//Open-source NoSQL database - not relational, no query language
//Document-oriented 
//Great for unstructured data, especially when you have a lot of it
//Created in 2007, open-sourced in 2009, "humongous"

//Mongo vs. SQL
//SQL: Database > table > row
//Mongo: Database > collections > documents
//Documents exist independently and can have different fields - dynamic schema
//all data gets grouped together within a document
//Collections are groups of documents

//Interact with MongoDB through the terminal command line, uses JavaScript
$ mongo
    >
    Starts the shell
    //uses JavaScript variable assignments and documents are JSON-like objects. 
    //{
    //field: value pairs must be separated by a ,
    //}

    > use dbname //opens db or creates it, if it doesn't exist
    > db //shows name of current db
    > help //gives list of commands

    //storing documents in collections
    > db.potions.insert( //always start with db to access database. 
        //specify collection name (collection is automatically created). and operation to preform()
        { //parameter of insert()
            "name": "Invisibility",
            "vendor": "Kettlecooked"
        }
    )

WriteResult({ "nInserted": 1 }) //tells us whether or not the operation was successful, nInserted - number of documents inserted into db

    > db.potions.find() {  //find() retrieves all documents from a collection
        "_id": ObjectID("559f07d..."), //automatically generates a unique ID
        "name": "Invisibility",
        "vendor": "Kettlecooked"
    }
